## Introduction

Gesture recognition is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand and interpret human hand movements. In this project, we utilize CNNs to train a model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image data. This can have practical applications in various domains, including human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and robotics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [LeapGestRecog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) from Kaggle. It consists of images representing various hand gestures, each associated with a specific label. The dataset is preprocessed, and data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's generalization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
2. Install the required Python libraries:


## Usage

1. Download the LeapGestRecog Dataset from Kaggle and extract it.

2. Set the dataset directory path in the `data_dir` variable in the code.

3. Run the main code file to train the hand gesture recognition model:


4. Monitor the training progress using TensorBoard logs and checkpoints.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used for this project consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy on both the training and validation sets. The training and validation loss and accuracy trends are visualized using Matplotlib plots.
